# 3D Card Flip Effect

## Overview

This project demonstrates a 3D card flip effect created using CSS. The effect allows a card to rotate on hover, revealing its differently colored back side. This visually appealing effect leverages CSS properties like `perspective` and `transform-style: preserve-3d` to create a realistic 3D depth and maintain three-dimensional transformations.

## Features

- **3D Card Flip**: On hover, the card rotates to show its back side.
- **CSS Perspective**: Creates a sense of depth in the 3D transformation.
- **Transform-Style**: Ensures that child elements maintain their 3D positioning.
- **Smooth Animation**: Uses CSS transitions for a smooth flip effect.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the card.
- **CSS**: For styling the card and implementing the 3D flip effect.
